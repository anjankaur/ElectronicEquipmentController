# ElectronicEquipmentController
Controller which takes inputs from sensors and controls various equipments for a hotel(practice java appliaction)

Hotel with multiple floors, each floor having corridors and sub corridors, has motion sensors installed in the corridors. 
Motion in sub-corridors is input to the controller, which needs to keep track and optimise the
power consumption.  
Program that takes input values for Floors, Main corridors, Sub corridors and takes
different external inputs for motion in sub corridors. For each input, the program prints out the
state of all the lights and ACs in the hotel. The controller toggles ACs on a corridor if the power consumption of a floor exceeds max power consumption.  
Class FullRunTest contains one flow of the solution.
